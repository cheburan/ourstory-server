 * shown, hide the button after 'timeUntilFade' milliseconds. If the video is
 * paused, don't fade the button
 * 
 * @param {boolean} isPlaying - state for whether the video is playing or not
 * @param {number} timeUntilFade - the number of seconds from when the video
 * is playing and the play/pause button is shown until the play/pause button is
 * faded.
